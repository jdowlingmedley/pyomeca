# Getting Started

## Installation

motion itself is a pure Python package, but its dependencies are not.
The easiest way to get everything installed is to use [conda](https://conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).
To install motion with its recommended dependencies using the conda command line tool:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge motion
```

Now that motion is installed, you should be able to import it:


```python
import motion
```

## Core data structures

Motion have several data structures, which build upon and extend the core strengths of [xarray](http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/index.html).

- Analogs
- Markers
- Angles
- Rototrans
